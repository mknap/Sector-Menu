# Sector menu

A gnome shell extension (my first, see below) to show a list of apps and other shortcuts/actions in a group of sectors around the mouse pointer.

Provides quick access to apps in favorites list.
Provides quick access to a command line (like Alt-f2)

Will have
* customizable accessible icons
* command history
* pretty stuff
* monitoring and other info in background
* quick access to overview mode


## My first extension
TODO:
* [  ] Import my other README.md from disk
* [  ] Get github commits history in sync with local commits

## Follow the notes
 Just curious. Can we reference other files from within the markdown?
 For example, can we go to [Notes](notes.md) ?
