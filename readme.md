# Sector menu

A gnome shell extension (my first, see below) to show a list of apps and other shortcuts/actions in a group of sectors around the mouse pointer.

## My first extension
TODO:
* [ ]  Import my other README.md from disk
* [  ] Get github commits history in sync with local commits

## Follow the notices
 Just curious. Can we reference other files from within the markdown?
 For example, can we go to [notes.md](notes.md) ?
